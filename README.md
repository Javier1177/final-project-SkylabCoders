# Thunder-Bid

### This project is a full stack app and explores how to do a Ract app combined with events on client side with socket.io

[Documentation](doc)

[Demo App](Soon!)

If you want to try the app on your pc:

1- You should run the api server (Need a mongodb initiated)

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Javier1177/final-project-SkylabCoders.git
$ cd thunder-bid/server/api
$ npm i
$ npm start
```

2- Now you should run the client

```
$ cd thunder-bid/client 
$ npm i
$ npm start
```

3- Go to http://localhost:3000/ to visit the app
